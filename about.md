Hi! I'm Rishi Sagar. Thank you for visiting my internet home. My goal is to improve my critical thinking skills by learning to write concisely on topics ranging from decentralisation and risk to culture and pop fiction – and connect with a global audience in the process.

Here’s a quick 10 second rundown of trivia about me:

- Current role: Associate Product Manager @ Sprinklr
- Native of Hyderabad, India
- Favorite piece of music: [Souped Up](https://youtu.be/KIVD2pttHlQ?si=6ffSbtOQJ50oqRC5) by Michael Giacchino
- Undergrad + Masters at IIT Kanpur, majoring in Economics
- The best product I have used: a symptom assessment app called [Ada](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ada-check-your-health/id1099986434)
- Favorite book: [Ender’s Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game), by Orson Scott Card
- Mildly superstitious about: socks
- Word I have the most positive connotations with: whimsy!

The single unifying theme across the many different posts that I hope to cover here is, quite simply, personal curiosity. I strive to write simple, intelligent, insightful essays about ideas that I think are important in the grand scheme of things, or ideas that I believe we should be having more conversations about.

I thoroughly enjoy discussion and I welcome all feedback – especially if it’s negative. I also delight in making new friends. Please ping me if you have any suggestions, or even if you just want to say hello!

Once again, thanks for stumbling upon my little blog. If you want to start exploring right away, I’d suggest you to start with My Homepage. It features some of my favourite creations. I also maintain a running list of the most interesting things I’ve ever come across on the internet – it’s called Nuggets.

Goodbye for now, and keep growing,

Rishi
